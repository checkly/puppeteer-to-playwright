`puppeteer-to-playwright` automatically converts Javascript Puppeteer scripts to Playwright, aiming to reduce the amount of manual work involved in such a migration (ideally reducing it to zero). It is heavily based on [jscodeshift](https://github.com/facebook/jscodeshift).

## üë∑ Features

`puppeteer-to-playwright` will convert your existing Puppeteer script to Playwright, including:

- Converting import statements
- Converting basic methods to match new API (e.g. `setViewport` to `setViewportSize` and similar)
- Creating browser context explicitly
- Eliminating explicit waiting (unless `STRICT` mode is enabled)
- Converting cookies-related commands

### üõë Currently unsupported

- File upload
- File download
- Request/response interception

## üö¢ Getting Started

You can use `puppeteer-to-playwright` on a script file or multiple scripts at a time.

> _It will overwrite the script file when run_, so we recommend doing a dry-run first

### Dry run

A dry run will run the conversion without acutally writing to the file(s) you point it at.

```
$ npm run convert -- -d my-puppeteer-script.js
```

You can add `-p` to print out the resulting script:

```
$ npm run convert -- -d -p my-puppeteer-script.js
```

> You can pass additional jscodeshift parameters as described in the [project's repository]((https://github.com/facebook/jscodeshift)).

### Convert script

```
$ npm run convert my-puppeteer-script.js
```

### Convert entire folder of scripts

```
$ npm run convert my-puppeteer-folder
```
